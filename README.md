# Candle Landing Page

This project is a simple landing page for a fictional candle company. It showcases my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a responsive and visually appealing website.

**Features:**

* **Responsive Design:** The page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).
* **Visually Appealing:** Utilizes CSS for styling with a focus on clean and modern aesthetics.
* **Interactive Elements:** Includes basic JavaScript for enhancing user experience (e.g., smooth scrolling, animations).
* **SEO Considerations:** Basic SEO practices are implemented, such as proper HTML structure and meaningful headings.

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML:** For structuring the content of the page.
* **CSS:** For styling the page's appearance and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and enhancing user experience.

**Getting Started:**

**To improve this project:**
